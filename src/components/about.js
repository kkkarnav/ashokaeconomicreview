          Ashoka University Economic Review (AUER) is a premier peer-reviewed
          Economics publication run by the student body of Ashoka University in
          India. Founded in 2020, it is a 100% non-profit publication that
          constitutes online articles, scholar-interviews and original
          student-run economic research.

          The review is an endeavour to encourage scholarship in the rapidly
          emerging and dynamic fields of Economics. In recognition of the
          growing development challenges of the world today, AUER envisions a
          forum for students to voice their views on current economic issues and
          ultimately to foster a community of aspiring economists.
